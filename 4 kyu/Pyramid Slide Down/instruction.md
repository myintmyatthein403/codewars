## Pyramid Slide Down
### Lyrics...

Pyramids are amazing! Both in architectural and mathematical sense. If you have a computer, you can mess with pyramids even if you are not in Egypt at the time. For example, let's consider the following problem. Imagine that you have a pyramid built of numbers, like this one here:

```
   /3/
  \7\ 4 
 2 \4\ 6 
8 5 \9\ 3

```

### Here comes the task...

Let's say that the  _'slide down'_  is the maximum sum of consecutive numbers from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. As you can see, the longest  _'slide down'_  is  `3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23`

Your task is to write a function that takes a pyramid representation as an argument and returns its  **largest**  _'slide down'_. For example:

```
* With the input `[[3], [7, 4], [2, 4, 6], [8, 5, 9, 3]]`
* Your function should return `23`.

```

### By the way...

My tests include some extraordinarily high pyramids so as you can guess, brute-force method is a bad idea unless you have a few centuries to waste. You must come up with something more clever than that.
