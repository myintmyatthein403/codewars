## Strip Comments

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

**Example:**

Given an input string of:

```
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples

```

The output expected would be:

```
apples, pears
grapes
bananas

```

The code would be called like so:

```python
result = strip_comments("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
# result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"

```
