def is_valid_walk(walk):
    return len(walk) == 10 and walk.count('n') == walk.count('s') and walk.count('e') == walk.count('w')

# Explanation:
# Why does the function check if the length of the walk is equal to 10?
# The function is_valid_walk(walk) is designed to check if a given walk is valid. A valid walk must consist of exactly 10 steps.
# The function first checks if the length of the walk is equal to 10 using the len() function. If the length is not 10, the function returns False immediately, indicating that the walk is invalid.
#
# Why does the function check if the count of 'n' is equal to the count of 's' and the count of 'e' is equal to the count of 'w'?
# The function also checks if the count of 'n' is equal to the count of 's' and the count of 'e' is equal to the count of 'w'. This condition ensures that the walk returns to the starting point after 10 steps.
# If the counts of 'n' and 's' are not equal, or the counts of 'e' and 'w' are not equal, the walk does not return to the starting point, and the function returns False.
# If all conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that the walk is valid.
# By checking the length of the walk and the counts of each direction, the function validates whether the walk is valid based on the specified criteria.
